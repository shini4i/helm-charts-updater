## Project Description

> The project is still in a testing phase. Some issues might occur.

The use case is relatively niche. The idea is that there are a lot of helm charts in a single git
repository, and it is required to bump both chart version and appVersion from a pipeline in a different repository.

That's all that this automation will do.

So it is required that the selected helm chart uses appVersion as an image tag.

It might be a good tandem for the [chart-releaser-action](https://github.com/helm/chart-releaser-action).

## Example Workflow

```bash
- name: Update helm chart
  uses: shini4i/helm-charts-updater@v0.1.2
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
    gh_user: shini4i
    gh_repo: charts
    chart_name: my-chart
    app_version: ${{ github.ref_name }}

    # Optional. Whether helm docs should be generated for the
    # selected chart. Defaults to true.
    generate_docs: true

    # Optional. Whether the README should be updated with the table of existing charts.
    # Defaults to true.
    # NOTE: It is required to have the following comments in the README.md file:
    # <!-- table_start -->
    # <!-- table_end -->
    # The table would be generated between those two comments.
    update_readme: true
