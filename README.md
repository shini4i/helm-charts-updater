## Project Description

> The project is still in a testing phase. Some issues might occur.

The use case is relatively niche. The idea is that there are a lot of helm charts in a single git
repository, and it is required to bump both chart version and appVersion from a pipeline in a different repository.

So it is required that the selected helm chart uses appVersion as an image tag.

Additionally, it can generate helm readme and generate table of the existing charts in the main README.md file.

It might be a good tandem for the [chart-releaser-action](https://github.com/helm/chart-releaser-action).
